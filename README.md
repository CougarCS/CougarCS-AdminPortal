# CougarCS Admin Portal üíº

CougarCS is the largest student-run Computer Science organization at the University of Houston. 
At CougarCS, our mission is to smoothly transition our inexperienced members into young professionals by the end of their degree and to provide support and assistance to members who struggle academically or who need career guidance.

This is the admin portal for **CougarCS**. The portal is designed for officers to manage data of the organization. 

The portal is built with NextJS and TypeScript. 
The backend is built with ExpressJS and TypeScript. The database is built with MySQL.
You can view to the backend repository [here](https://github.com/CougarCS/astro-api).
